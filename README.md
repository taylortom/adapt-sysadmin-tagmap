This is an Adapt **authoring tool plugin** which displays a list of tags with their associated courses, and is **for Super Admin only**.

Note that this is a child plugin of the [adapt-sysadmin](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt-sysadmin/) plugin, and as such, will not work without it.

## Installation

1. Copy `sysadmin-tagmap` to `/frontend/src/plugins/` in your authoring tool folder.
2. Thatâ€™s it!
