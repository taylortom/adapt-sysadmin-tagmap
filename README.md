# adapt-sysadmin-tagmap

This is an Adapt **authoring tool plugin** which displays a list of tags with their associated courses.

This repo comes in two flavours: 
- A sysadmin plugin that integrates with the [adapt-sysadmin](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt-sysadmin) plugin.
- A globalMenu plugin that makes it accessible from the global menu.
